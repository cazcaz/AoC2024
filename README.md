# Advent of Code 2024
Completing Advent of Code 2024 while learning and using Rust. Uses `aocdl` (can't find the repo anymore!) to get the days input and downloads it into the repo.

## Aim
Use TDD and Rust's simple testing capabilities to make test cases included the examples on the website and then implement enough to get those tests to pass, and then get the result.
